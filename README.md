# my-book-live-debricker

Script to reinstall the operating system (debrick) on a harddrive that has been extracted from the housing of a [WD MyBook Live](http://www.wdc.com/sp/products/products.aspx?id=280)

The script included here is NOT my original work, it was taken from [MyBook live debricking guide osx and windows from usb](http://mybookworld.wikidot.com/mybook-live-debricking-guide-osx-and-windows) 

I had to edit that script a little bit to get it to work with my particular WD My Book Live. Since it was posted on a forum and without any versioning system or license I've decided to start this repo.

License is GPLv2, versioning is available for you to check, PRs are welcome but I guess there won't be much since by now this is an old piece of hardware.
